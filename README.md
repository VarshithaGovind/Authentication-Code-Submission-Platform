 Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
- Node.js & npm installed
- MongoDB installed and running locally
- A RapidAPI account and access to the Judge0 API

Installation

npm install
Configure environment variables
Create a .env file inside the Backend/ directory with the following content:
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/auth_system
JWT_SECRET=123456!@#$
RAPIDAPI_KEY=3717b1e3a9msh32a4b53bb66beccp1958e1jsn224c476d8f4b
Start the backend server
node server.js
Open the frontend
You can simply open the Frontend/index.html file in a browser or use Live Server in VS Code.

Project Flow 
1.User Registration/Login
→ User signs up or logs in.
→ JWT token is generated for authentication.
2.Fetch Coding Questions
→ Authenticated user gets a list of coding problems.
3.Write & Submit Code
→ User writes code and submits it for a selected question.
4.Code Execution (Judge0 API)
→ Backend sends code to Judge0 API for execution.
→ Output is received and compared with test cases.
5.Store Submission Result
→ Result (pass/fail) is stored in progress.json.
6.View Progress
→ User can view their solved/unsolved problems.
7.JWT-Protected Routes
→ Only logged-in users can access submissions, exercises, and progress.
